+ Instead of distributing all the binary files together,
  distrubte them separately and pull down the right one as needed, based on a system property.
  Look at maven-dependency-plugin for code on grabbing dependencies--and unpacking them.

+ give version ranges for our dependencies so we play nice in people's projects.

+ By default, generate the <cp> element automatically from the dependencies.

- What is up with downloading xstream every time?

+ Rename l4j to launch4j: package, groupId

+ Add a license file of my own.

+ Add license comment blocks to all files.

+ Rename from maven-launch4j-plugin to launch4j-maven-plugin.

+ Use mvn site to generate a site for this plugin.
    - javadoc should include private fields.
	- put something like the README in the index.html file.

+ Use maven to generate a source distro for this plugin.

- Move this to public svn (sourceforge?).

- Use maven release to release new versions.

- Add to <classPath>:
	<excludes>
		<exclude>
			<groupId></groupId>
			<artifactId></artifactId>
		</exclude>
		...
	</excludes>

+ Use ftp in <distributionManagement> to make updating my online repository easy.
  But don't put this in the POM with username & password, because that gets posted publicly!
    + getting NPE from ftp-wagon. (this was because I was missing a matching <server> in ~/.m2/settings.xml)

- add a snapshot repository, too.

- Don't run launch4j unless the inputs are newer than the output?

+ Improve logic on whether to unjar:
    + After unjarring, write the marker file.
	+ If the marker is there and newer than the jar, don't unjar.
	+ But if the jar is newer, unjar anyway.
	+ After unjarring, either write the marker file or touch it.

- dontWrapJar doesn't work?
	from an email:
	However (sorry!) I can't get <dontWrapJar> to work.  I have tried every combination of "target/" or "./", including using backslashes (in case of a platform specific-issue) but each results in:
	"Specify runtime path of the jar relative to executable"

	I would expect the following config should have worked. I have confirmed that it works from the root of the project using the commandline launch4j.

	<outfile>target/app.exe</outfile>
	<jar>app-1.0.jar</jar>

- support l4j 3.0.1

- support bundling the JRE (or figure out what parameters already allow this)
